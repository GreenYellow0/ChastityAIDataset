      "question": "How do I choose the right chastity cage size for me?",
      "answer": "Choosing the right chastity cage size is crucial for comfort and security. \nFollow these steps: \n\n1. Measure the Back Ring's circumference and calculate the diameter. \n2. Choose from circular, curved/oval, or curved hinged rings. \n3. Measure the Cage Length (flaccid) and subtract 1/4 to 1/2 inch for fit. \n4. Measure the Cage Internal Diameter by wrapping a string around and dividing by Pi (3.14). \n5. Consider the Gap between cage and ring based on body characteristics. \n\nFor more info, visit [House of Denial](https://www.houseofdenial.com/pages/how-to-measure-your-chastity-cage-and-ring-size)."
